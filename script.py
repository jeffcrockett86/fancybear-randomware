Hello, /b/. My name is Dr. Quentin Coldwater. I am here to explain
what this community is like to those who are new here.

/b/ is the world's largest online community of autistic children, teens,
yound adults, and thirtysomething NEETs who still live with their parents.

They're frustrated because autism makes it difficult to adjust to the
stresses of day to day life.

So they come here and say nigger and faggot a lot and post frog pictures. It calms them down and keeps
them from becoming hyperstimulated.

That is all. 

Pic related :)
